			<p style="text-align:justify;">myAcorn have worked with the <a href="http://www.pcmd.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Peninsula Medical School</a> on two websites related to diabetes research. Developed using the <a href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> content management system, these sites contain advanced features to enable multiple users to log in and have access to different files and folders.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify;">The Collaborative European Effort to Develop Diabetes Diagnostics (CEED3) is a health research project funded by the European Commission. By developing diagnostic tools to differentiate diabetic subgroups the project aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with diabetes.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify;">The Diabetes Genes website, completely redeveloped by myAcorn, aims to provide information on research and clinical care in genetic types of diabetes. The website is a national resource for GPs and patients with diabetes.</p>
