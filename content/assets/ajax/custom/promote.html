			<p style="text-align:justify">ProMOTE aims to determine the predictive power of microalbuminuria after a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) or minor stroke for further cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes of the study include furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of acute change in microalbuminuria in the setting of acute vascular events. The study is being conducted across the South West of England, in eight different NHS Trusts.</p>
