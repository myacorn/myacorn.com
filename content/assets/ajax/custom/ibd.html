			<p style="text-align:justify">myAcorn have developed a new website for a study being conducted by the UK IBD Genetics Consortium. The aim of the study is to predict drug side effects in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the site includes seven case report forms linked to an online database. Staff at participating hospitals are able to enter patient data into the secure online database via the web forms. The data can then be downloaded by the UK IBD Genetics Consortium for analysis.</p>

			<!--The forms are divided into sections and data are saved each time the user clicks the next or back buttons. -->

			<p style="text-align:justify">When logged in, users of the website can view of a history of the forms that they have submitted. They can also continue to enter data into forms that are partially complete.</p>
			<!--	<p style="text-align:justify;">The project required a complex web form capable of saving data to and loading data from the database. The form includes required fields, date pickers, drop-down menus, radio buttons and resizable text boxes. In addition the form also includes several advanced features such as the disabling / enabling of form fields and calculation of field values based on the values input to other fields.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon form submission email alerts are automatically sent if certain criteria have been met.</p> -->
