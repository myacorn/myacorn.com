			<p style="text-align:justify">In collaboration with UK charity Pond Conservation, myAcorn have developed an online GIS, supported by <a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/" target="_blank">Natural England</a> through Defra's Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund. The website enables users to find out which pond-associated <a href="http://www.ukbap.org.uk/" target="_blank">Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP)</a> species occur at any site in England, which such species occur near existing mineral sites and also provides users with advice on pond creation for pond-associated BAP species.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">The project demonstrates the use of dynamic maps to display information on the spatial distributions of species and habitats that may have potential for pond creation. Data layers displayed include 
			<ol>
			<li>10 km squares (hectads) showing the presence / absence of each species in two time periods - i) historical records from prior to 1986 and ii) 'current' records from the period 1986 to 2010. These data were obtained from the <a href="http://data.nbn.org.uk/" target="_blank">National Biodiversity Network's gateway</a> and from a variety of specialist organisations.
			<li>Aggregate / mineral sites across the UK. Rather than being displayed as point locations, polygons have been displayed to accurately represent the size and shape of these operations.
			<li>Recent species records at a 1km scale are also used in the website, but these data are not made available to the general public.
			</ol></p> 

			<p style="text-align:justify">The website contains simple navigation tools to enable users to pan, zoom and return to previous map extents with ease. In addition, specially customised search tools allow users to click on a geographic location or aggregate site of interest and to return lists of species and aggregate sites within a 1km or 5km radius of that location.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to the spatial content, species profiles containing short descriptions of each species and key points to consider when creating ponds for them are also included in the website. These profiles were compiled by Naomi Ewald of the University of Sussex with advice from specialists on the BAP species.</p>
