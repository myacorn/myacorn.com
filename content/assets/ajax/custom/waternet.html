			<p style="text-align:justify">myAcorn are working with the <a href="http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/" target="_blank">Freshwater Habitats Trust</a> to develop a web portal for the <a href="http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/projects/people-ponds-water/" target="_blank">People Ponds and Water Project</a>, funded predominantly by the <a href="http://www.hlf.org.uk/our-projects/people-ponds-and-water-project#.VYavbUavODk" target="_blank">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>. Volunteers will use interactive mapping tools to sign up to a range of survey options for existing sites or to add their own sites for survey. Volunteers will then be able to enter their survey results via web forms and to upload files to support these. Raw data, summary data and calculated metrics e.g., <a href="http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/habitats/surveys/nps-psym-methods/psym-method/" target="_blank">PSYM scores</a> will be available for volunteers to explore or download. Editors will be able to log in and verify records and uploaded files.</p>
			<p>While the WaterNet website is under development, volunteers may choose their survey site using a <a href="http://www.freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/projects/pondnet/choose-your-pondnet-survey-site/" target="_blank">simple mapping tool</a> developed by myAcorn Limited.</p>
