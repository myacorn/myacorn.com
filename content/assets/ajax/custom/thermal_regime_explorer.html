		<p style="text-align:justify">The <a href="http://msel.abcgis.co.uk/tre/" target="_blank">thermal regime explorer</a> is a demonstration project for displaying spatial information on coral reefs in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/" target="_blank">Marine Spatial Ecology Lab</a> at the University of Queensland. The explorer is a global product that includes coral reefs mapped by the <a href="http://imars.usf.edu/MC/index.html">Millenium Coral Reef Mapping project</a>. Users of the website can view maps of variations in thermal stress which can be used to help manage reefs for climate change.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Reefs were divided into polygons of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup> which were then classified by their thermal regime. Thermal regimes were determined using proxies of chronic and acute thermal stress experienced, see Mumby <i>et al</i>. (2011) for more information. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As reefs were mapped at a global scale the three-dimensional Google Earth plugin was chosen to provide a better sense of scale and distance than a two-dimensional map. Users may 'fly to' different coral reef regions (e.g., the Bahamas, the Great Barrier Reef) by selecting the appropriate name from a drop-down list, and view the thermal regime data of interest.</p>
